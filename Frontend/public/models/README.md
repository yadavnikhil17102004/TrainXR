# 3D Models Directory

This directory contains the 3D models used in the AR view of the application.

## Models

- `squat.glb` - 3D model for squat exercise demonstration
- `pushup.glb` - 3D model for push-up exercise demonstration
- `plank.glb` - 3D model for plank exercise demonstration

## Usage

These models are automatically loaded by the AR view when the user selects the corresponding exercise. The models should be in GLB format for optimal performance.

## Replacing Models

To replace a model:
1. Export your 3D model in GLB format
2. Replace the existing file with the same name
3. Ensure the model is properly scaled (human-sized, ~1.5 scale)
4. Test the model in the application to ensure it displays correctly
